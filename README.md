## About the Project

This repository contains core machine learning concepts and implementations across **supervised**, **unsupervised**, and foundational **math** topics. It serves as a personal learning journey and a reference point for ML algorithms, model evaluation techniques, and preprocessing pipelines.

Each folder (e.g., `supervised_learning`, `unsupervised_learning`, `math`) includes documented code and modular implementations. The goal is to reinforce concepts in a clean, testable, and educational format.
